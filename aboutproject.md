## The Small Aral Sea Hydrologic Investigations (SMASHI Project)

The project is devoted to the Small Aral Sea water balance components investigation under changing climatic and anthropogenic conditions. We want to accumulate all relevant data sources and expertise to tackle difficulties in prediction and forecasting the modern state of the Small Aral Sea. Our solutions are open to reproduction and discussion by a community or interested citizen groups. We are highly motivated to raise the scientific discussion around the modern Aral Sea on a higher level.

## Funding

The project was funded by the Russian Fund for Basic Research (grant number 17-05-01175).

## History of the initiative

The idea of the project was raised in a way home after the 19th Aral Expedition by the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology in June 2016.

We are looking forward to continuing our research for better understanding water balance formation processes in one of the most complicated regions in the world.
