Hi!

Here we present our discussion on SMASHI-firts-year-results. This videoblog  was recorded during SMASHI team-meeting in University of Potsdam (Germany) in February, 2018. Video is in Russian language, sorry :)

Although it was our first experience in video blogging, we have a podcast project concerning different scientific subjects and scientist's life.. This podcast called Plovcast is also in Russian language. Please, find more [here](https://vk.com/plovcast).
